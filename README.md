# [Superhi - Foundation HTML, CSS + Javascript Course](https://www.superhi.com/courses/html-css-javascript-foundation?)

I am taking this Superhi course to get more comfortable with CSS and learn JavaScript. What drew me to the course were the projects which are really creative and fun.

## Week 1 - What I learnt / key concepts

- vh( viewport height) makes the height relative to the height of the browser window.
- A scroll effect,created with `background-attachment: fixed;`  which fixes the background to the browser viewport rather than to the section,creating a reveal effect as we scroll 
- `background-size: cover; ` will cover the full width and height of our section without skewing or repeating the image
