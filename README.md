# [Superhi - Foundation HTML, CSS + Javascript Course](https://www.superhi.com/courses/html-css-javascript-foundation?)

I am taking this Superhi course to get more comfortable with CSS and learn JavaScript. What drew me to the course were the projects which are really creative and fun.<br>
Each project has it's own README ,where I go into detail about key concepts I learnt each week and more details on what project was about.
