Week 1 was about creating parallax style websites using HTML and CSS.

- vh( viewport height) makes the height relative to the height of the browser window.
- A scroll effect,created with `background-attachment: fixed;`  which fixes the background to the browser viewport rather than to the section,creating a reveal effect as we scroll
- `background-size: cover; ` will cover the full width and height of our section without skewing or repeating the image
