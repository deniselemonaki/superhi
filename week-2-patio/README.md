[project](https://patio-1798.superhi.com/) </br>
Week 2 was about creating single-column websites and responsive design. I used mostly the Google Developer Tools to inspect the site,break it down and
testing it to make it responsive.

- media queries let you adapt your site or app depending on the presence or value of various device characteristics and parameters.
They are a key component of responsive design. For example, a media query can shrink the font size on small devices, increase the padding between paragraphs when a page is viewed in portrait mode, or bump up the size of buttons on touchscreens.
For example ` @media (max-width:740px)`,when our screen  width is below 740px ,these styles will be applied,which is an extremely powerful feauture of css.it allows us to conditionally  apply styles at certain screen widths 
- Deeper dive into margins and paddings,when to use each one
-  Flexible and responsive widths & testing on
devices
- Line height acts as a multiplier of the font-size
- Adding the Twitter follow button and the Facebook like button
- `max width` this will make our page width fluid up until it reaches the width that we specify, and then it will stop growing.This is an easy way to make our websites responsive by default
- `margin:auto`  by using auto margins, our column of content is centered on the page
